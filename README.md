This is a simple raytracer written in C++. It is based on the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley. The code is written in a way that it is easy to understand and modify. The code is not optimized for speed, but for readability. The code is not meant to be used in production, but as a learning tool.

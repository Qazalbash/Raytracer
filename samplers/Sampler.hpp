/**
   This file declares the Sampler class which is an abstract class for concrete
   samplers to inherit from.

   A sampler samples a scene by shooting primary rays through pixels in a
   viewplane. A primary ray begins at the pixel and its direction is determined
   by a camera. Different samplers shoot different numbers of primary rays in
   different manners.
